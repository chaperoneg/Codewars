// A sequence or a series, in mathematics, is a string of objects, like numbers, that follow a particular pattern. The individual elements in a sequence are called terms. A simple example is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ..., where the pattern is: "add 3 to the previous term".

// In this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ... This sequence is generated with the pattern: "the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive".

// [ 0,  1,    3,      6,   ...]
//   0  0+1  0+1+2  0+1+2+3

function sumOfN(n) {
    // insert here your code
      let ans = [0]
     
      for (let i =1; i <= Math.abs(n); i++){
        ans.push(ans[i-1] + i*Math.sign(n))
      }
      return ans
    };
